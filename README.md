# Malware Revealer
Spot malwares using Machine Learning techniques


# Architecture
This is what Malware Revealer will looks like:

### Feature extractor
It is responsible for taking an executable as input, doing the necessary parsing and extraction of features that should be relevant, to be able to classify our executable as malware or not.

The extractor should be able to extract features from multiple types of executable which are meant to different CPU architectures.

This part will be used to build our dataset from malware samples.

### Model
This is our trained model that should take features from the extractor as input and outputs the likelihood of the executable to be a malware.

# Usability
We should host this as a public API to be usable by everyone on the internet.
